            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <p>Parents today, with all the pressure from work and sex, 
                aren’t left with much time for their children - especially for
                 going through resources that would boost their child’s development. With rising
                  competition among kids from fucking Bay Areas and what not, parents today need
                   an ensemble of material, resources, communication methods, etc. to improve everything,
                    from bearing of their children to choosing colleges for them.

            <p>We aim to enhance parenting experience by giving our users exactly what they need
                 - all with a personalized experience. Examples include articles by experts on
                  what to spend money on for their child, forums where different parents can share their
                   experiences on what steps they took, and a digital service management system where a parent 
                   can see the nearest creches which are managed by private organizations or the government and drop their kids there until they come back.
